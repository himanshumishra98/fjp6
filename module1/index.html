    The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Where the hell are they. Yeah, who are you? Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike.

    Its good. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. The hell you doing to my car? Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong?
    
    Yeah, I think maybe you do. Doc. What did I just say? Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.
